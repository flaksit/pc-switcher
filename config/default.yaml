# PC-switcher Default Configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.config/pc-switcher/config.yaml and customize.

# =============================================================================
# LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Controls what gets logged to file and terminal.
# Available levels (from most to least verbose):
#   DEBUG    - Verbose diagnostics for development
#   FULL     - Detailed file-level operations
#   INFO     - High-level operations and milestones
#   WARNING  - Potential issues that don't stop sync
#   ERROR    - Recoverable errors (sync continues)
#   CRITICAL - Unrecoverable errors (sync aborts)

log_file_level: FULL    # Recommended: FULL for troubleshooting
log_cli_level: INFO     # Recommended: INFO for normal operation

# =============================================================================
# DISK SPACE MONITORING
# =============================================================================
# Prevents sync from filling disks. Both thresholds can be:
# - Float 0.0-1.0: Percentage of total disk (e.g., 0.10 = 10%)
# - Integer: Absolute bytes (e.g., 10737418240 = 10GB)

disk:
  # Pre-flight check: sync doesn't start if free space below this threshold
  min_free: 0.20          # 20% free space required to start sync

  # Runtime check: abort immediately if free space drops below during sync
  reserve_minimum: 0.15   # Abort if free space falls below 15%

  # Monitoring frequency during sync (seconds)
  check_interval: 30      # Check every 30 seconds

# =============================================================================
# SYNC MODULES
# =============================================================================
# Modules execute in the order listed here. Each module handles a specific
# aspect of system synchronization.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - btrfs_snapshots MUST be first and enabled (data safety requirement)
# - Order matters: dependencies must be listed before dependents
# - Disabled modules (false) are skipped but must have valid config

sync_modules:
  # Required module: creates snapshots for safety and rollback
  btrfs_snapshots: true

  # Test modules (for development/testing only)
  # dummy_success: false   # Simulates successful sync operation
  # dummy_critical: false  # Tests error handling (fails at 50%)
  # dummy_fail: false      # Tests exception propagation

# =============================================================================
# MODULE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATIONS
# =============================================================================

# Btrfs Snapshots Module
# Creates read-only snapshots before and after sync for data safety.
# Provides rollback capability if sync fails.
btrfs_snapshots:
  # Subvolumes to snapshot (flat names from 'btrfs subvolume list /')
  # These must exist on both source and target machines.
  # Add or remove subvolumes as needed for your system.
  subvolumes:
    - "@"        # Root filesystem (mounted at /)
    - "@home"    # Home directory (mounted at /home)
    - "@root"    # Root user's home (mounted at /root)
    # - "@etc"     # System configuration (mounted at /etc) (if applicable)

  # Directory where snapshots are stored
  # Format: {snapshot_dir}/{subvol}-{presync|postsync}-{timestamp}-{session_id}
  # Example: /.snapshots/@-presync-20250116T123045Z-a1b2c3d4
  snapshot_dir: "/.snapshots"

  # Retention policy for automatic cleanup
  keep_recent: 3         # Always keep N most recent sync sessions
  max_age_days: 7        # Delete snapshots older than N days

# Test module configurations (for development only)
# dummy_success:
#   duration_seconds: 20  # How long to simulate sync operation

# dummy_critical:
#   fail_at_percentage: 50  # Progress percentage at which to fail

# dummy_fail:
#   message: "Intentional test failure"  # Error message to raise
