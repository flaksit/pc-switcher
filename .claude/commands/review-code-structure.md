Review the python code of this project with a focus on code architecture and code design. Eliminate any dead code. Propose refactorings or other changes where needed for clean, understandable, well structured code.

**Materiality guidance:** Propose changes only when:
- Dead code exists that should be removed
- Structure actively hinders understanding or modification
- Clear violations of project architecture patterns

Do NOT raise issues about:
- Minor style preferences beyond established project standards
- Refactoring for refactoring's sake
- "I would have done it differently" suggestions

If the code structure is already clean and well-organized, say so. Don't invent refactoring work.
