description: Resolve feedback received on a speckit feature implementation
---

We use speckit as workflow to implement features in this project. The feature we are currently working has a specific feature folder under specs/ with the same name as the current branch. In the feature folder, there is a spec.md file that contains the specification of the feature.

We just finished the resolution of the feedback of a quality review of the planning phase of the feature. However, there are some follow-up questions/feedback:


## Feedback

$ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

If one or more github issues are referenced in the feedback, make sure to read them first: title, description and all the comments.

For each point in the feedback, follow a structured workflow to resolve it:
1. Analyze the feedback and context. If anything is unclear, ask clarifying questions first and wait for my answers.
2. Fix all documents of the plan according to the feedback

## Output
Append a report of this "follow-up session" to the existing file "plan-review-N-resolution.md" that has the highest number N. The goal is to have a trace of any decisions we make while resolving the feedback. The report should contain the following:
- The literal ARGUMENTS text passed to you when invoking this command.
- A log of any further conversation we have while you are resolving the feedback. Include ALL my prompts and your output LITERALY, e.g. your clarifying questions and my answers as well.
