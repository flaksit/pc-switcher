High-level architecture review of the 003-foundation-tests plan artifacts.

1) Conflicting target architectures across documents: `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, and `contracts/coverage-map.yaml` define a lean, spec-driven structure (unit tests grouped by component, integration tests by user story with 19 files), while `pre-analysis/testing-implementation-plan.md` and `pre-analysis/testing-report.md` prescribe a much larger, different file layout (e.g., `tests/unit/test_config.py`, `tests/integration/test_orchestrator.py`) and even claim “Full” coverage already. Two divergent plans break “Deliberate Simplicity” and “Up-to-date Documentation” in the constitution and make it unclear which structure to implement. Please reconcile to a single authoritative layout and retire or revise the outdated documents.

2) Inconsistent directory conventions for the same tests: the current tree has `tests/unit/test_jobs/test_disk_space_monitor.py`, but `contracts/coverage-map.yaml` and `data-model.md` reference `tests/unit/jobs/test_disk_space_monitor.py` while `pre-analysis/testing-implementation-plan.md` lists yet another set of paths. This ambiguity risks duplicate files and broken traceability for FR-016/FR-017 and related edge cases. Pick one canonical path scheme and align all plan artifacts and mappings to it.

3) Spec-traceability relies on manual sync: the plan emphasizes 100% mapping from requirements to tests, but there is no mechanism described to generate or validate `contracts/coverage-map.yaml` against the actual test suite or spec changes. Without automation or a defined verification step, the mapping is likely to drift, undermining the “Reliability Without Compromise” and “Up-to-date Documentation” principles. Consider adding a documented generation/validation workflow (e.g., tooling in tasks/CI) to keep the coverage map authoritative.
