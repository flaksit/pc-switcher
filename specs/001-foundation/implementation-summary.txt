  - ✅ pytest: 19+ tests passing
  - ✅ Full type hints throughout codebase

  Deliverables:
  - 23 Python source files (src/ + tests/)
  - 4 Documentation files (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING)
  - 2 CI/CD workflows (ci.yml, release.yml)
  - 1 Installation script (setup.sh)
  - 2 Configuration examples (minimal, full-featured)
  - Project configuration (pyproject.toml, .tool-versions, .gitignore, uv.lock)

  🚀 Ready for Testing

  You can now test and review the implementation with these commands:

  # Run full test suite
  uv run pytest

  # Type check all code
  uv run basedpyright src/

  # Lint all code
  uv run ruff check src/

  # Spell check
  uv run codespell src/ tests/

  # Test sync command (runs dummy modules)
  uv run python -m pcswitcher sync localhost

  # View logs
  uv run python -m pcswitcher logs --last

  # Setup on target machine
  chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
  ./scripts/setup.sh

  📚 Documentation Ready

  - README.md: Installation, quick start, configuration, troubleshooting
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Design patterns, state diagrams, module interface
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Development setup, testing, PR workflow
  - examples/: Sample configurations (minimal and full-featured)

  🔄 CI/CD Ready

  - GitHub Actions CI: Runs on every push (ruff, basedpyright, pytest, codespell)
  - GitHub Actions Release: Publishes to ghcr.io on release
  - Automated version: Dynamic versioning from Git tags
